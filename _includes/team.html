                    <p class="large text-muted">Marc-Andre, or bazmarc as he is known in the LEGO community, has always had a passion for all things related to printing. Back in 1995, he worked at a sticker factory prior to studying Industrial Engineering at university. Following this, he worked for over 20 years at IBM as a Support Specialist for Power Systems. In the fall of 2018, Marc-Andre chose the entrepreneurial path. First, he became the new owner of Le Flag Shop Montreal (see full story <a href="http://blog.flagshop.com/announcing-new-ownership-of-the-flag-shop-montreal/">here</a>). Then, at about the same time, he took over Millionprints.com a small company he used to deal with for all his custom prints on LEGO elements. In addition, Marc-André is also an AFOL (Adult Fan of LEGO) and the ambassador of the MINDSTORMS® Community Partners which recently became the <a href="http://www.robotmak3rs.com/">ROBOTMAK3RS</a> RLOC (Recognized LEGO® Online Community). Over the years, the special printed bricks that he designed have became valuable collectables in the community. Today, Marc-Andre is able to combine his passion for printing, design, and LEGO through the services he provides at Millionrints.com. He combines an attention to detail, artistic sense, and an understanding of the LEGO community to bring quality products to everyone.</p>
