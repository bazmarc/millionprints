Following this, he worked for over 20 years at IBM as a Support Specialist for Power Systems. In the fall of 2018 Marc-Andre chose the entrepreneur path. First he became the new owner of Le Flag Shop Montreal (see full story here). Then, at about the same time, he took over Million-Prints.com a small company he used to deal with a lot for all his custom prints on LEGO elements. You see Marc-André is also an AFOL (Adult Fan of LEGO) and the ambassador of the MINDSTORMS® Community Partners that recently became the ROBOTMAK3RS RLOC (Recognized LEGO® Online Community). and preparing special printed bricks for events he was part of was always something that was truly appreciated by the whole community. Today, Marc-Andre is able to combine his passion for print and LEGO. He brings to the table an attention to detail, an artistic view and an understanding of the LEGO community</p>
